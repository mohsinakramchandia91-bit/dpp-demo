LDCE / DPP SYSTEM – THREAT MODEL
===============================

This document lists realistic threats and mitigations.

THREAT 1: DATA TAMPERING (POST-CREATION)
----------------------------------------
Risk:
- Someone edits DPP JSON after generation

Mitigation:
- SHA256 proof generated from full DPP

-----------------------------
Risk:
- Operator provides incorrect values

Mitigation:
- Confidence scoring
- Source tagging

Status: ACCEPTED (by regulation)

NOTE:
EU regulation does NOT require truth, it requires traceability.

THREAT 3: VERSION OVERWRITE
---------------------------
Risk:
- Old DPP versions lost

Mitigation:
- Versioned storage (v1, v2, v3...)
- No overwrite logic exists

Status: MITIGATED

THREAT 4: UNAUTHORIZED VERIFICATION
-----------------------------------
Risk:
- Auditor needs special access

Mitigation:
- Read-only CLI
- No secrets
- Public hash comparison

Status: MITIGATED

THREAT 5: SYSTEM MISINTERPRETATION
----------------------------------
