LDCE / DPP SYSTEM – LEGAL DEFENSIBILITY
======================================

This system is designed to be legally defensible under EU DPP principles.

KEY POINTS
----------

1. NO CLAIMS WITHOUT CONTEXT
   - All values include confidence scores
   - Source type is preserved

2. TRACEABILITY OVER PERFECTION
   - System records what was known, when
   - Does not fabricate missing data

3. IMMUTABLE HISTORY
   - Past DPP versions remain accessible
   - Lifecycle events are append-only

4. INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION
   - Cryptographic hash can be verified externally
   - No vendor dependency for verification

5. HUMAN + MACHINE READABLE
   - summary.txt for auditors
   - JSON for systems
   - HTML for buyers/consumers

LEGAL POSITION
--------------
This system does not assert absolute truth.
It asserts:
- Data lineage
- Decision logic
- Tamper evidence

This aligns with EU regulatory expectations for
Digital Product Passports.
